    <p>china has put Lanzhou, a city of four million people, under a strict lockdown amid the latest surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. China has asked residents of Lanzhou to not leave their residences unless itâ€™s an emergency.</p>
    
    <p>According to news agency AFP, China has recorded 29 new cases of Covid-19 with 6 of them being reported from Lanzhou. The lockdown restrictions in Lanzhou were announced on Tuesday, a day after the fresh cases.</p>
    <p>On Monday, China put thousands of people in northern China under strict restrictions at a time when Covid-19 cases are rising again in the country over the latest Delta variant outbreak.</p>
    <p>Officials in Beijing have also restricted access to tourist sites and advised residents not to leave the city unless necessary, although regular transport services continued as normal, reported AFP.</p>
    <p>China reported 39 new cases on Monday, bringing the tally from the latest Delta variant-linked outbreak to more than 100 cases over the past week.</p>
    <p>The numbers are extremely low compared with most places in the world, but China has pursued a zero-case strategy throughout the pandemic and authorities are determined to subdue the latest outbreak with the Winter Olympics just over 100 days away.</p>
    <p>Several housing blocks in Beijing have been locked down, and organisers on Sunday indefinitely postponed a marathon at which 30,000 runners were expected.</p>
    <p>Some 23,000 residents in one housing compound in Changping district have been ordered to stay indoors after nine cases were found there in recent days, local outlet Beijing News reported.</p>
    <p>Photos showed officials in hazmat suits standing watch outside the entrances to each apartment block, and the perimeter of the compound blocked by metal barricades.</p>
    <p>Entry will be restricted for people who have been to places with local Covid-19 infections in the last 14 days, Beijing's vice publicity minister said Monday.</p>
    <p>In the central city of Wuhan -- where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019 -- organisers abruptly cancelled another marathon Sunday that was expected to draw 26,000 participants.</p>
